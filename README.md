# GENSEN 42
Automatic bearer token generator for 42_API

This is an automatic generator of Bearer tokens to make requests to the API. An easy way beacuse you only needo to introduce your UID and SECRET keys. This script returns you the Bearer token and a .gnf file which contains the output data and date of generation. Let's see how it works...

Let's see how it works...

1. The first thing is to create a new application in the APIs area of the intra. Don´t worry about that form. Easy, right?
2. Run **gensen.sh** on your terminal. 
3. Insert the **UID** and **SECRET** key that the intra gives you after creating the application.
4. ✨🎉 Your Bearer token is already generated!!! ✨🎉

> Remember that the script returns a file called **genFile.gnf** that contains the returned information.
